            <p>

                For my inaugural project, I designed and developed the Portfolio website, showcasing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project involved creating a responsive and visually appealing website for a fictional client, incorporating modern design principles. I focused on user experience, implementing smooth navigation and interactive elements to enhance engagement. Through this project, I honed my skills in front-end development and gained hands-on experience in translating design concepts into functional web pages. The XYZ Website serves as a testament to my commitment to delivering high-quality, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly web solutions.

            <p>

                I recently undertook a challenging and exciting project to create a front-end clone of Netflix's user interface. This endeavor involved meticulously replicating the aesthetics and functionality of Netflix's renowned website, showcasing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focused on designing a responsive and user-friendly interface, incorporating features such as product listings, dynamic cart updates, and seamless navigation. Paying attention to detail, I ensured that the clone maintained the visual appeal and intuitive user experience characteristic of the original Amazon site. This project not only honed my front-end development skills but also deepened my understanding of e-commerce website design
